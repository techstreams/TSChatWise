There are three sheets within the **TSChatWise** template.

1. Lessons
2. Config
3. Examples

We've already seen how to use the **Config** sheet in the [Installation Guide](Install.md).  Now let's turn our attention on how to configure the **Lessons** sheet.

## Step 1: Configure Lessons

**TSChatWise** can post **two types** of lesson messages to Google Chat Rooms:

1. **[Simple Messages](https://developers.google.com/hangouts/chat/reference/message-formats/basic)** - plain text messages with simple formatting options.
2. **[Card Messages](https://developers.google.com/hangouts/chat/reference/message-formats/cards)** - more complex user interface card messages.

Now let's look at how the **TSChatWise** lesson sheet is constructed.
