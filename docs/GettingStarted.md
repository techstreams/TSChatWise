2. Config

We've already seen how to use the **Config** sheet in the [Installation Guide](Install.md).  Now let's learn how to configure the **Lessons** sheet.

<br>


## Step 1: Configure Lessons

**TSChatWise** can post **two types** of lesson messages to Google Chat Rooms:

1. **Simple Messages** - plain text messages with simple formatting options.
2. **Card Messages** - more complex user interface card messages.

> ðŸ‘‰ For more information on message types and formatting see [Usage Tips](Usage.md).

As show above, each row of the **Lesson** sheet represents a lesson to be posted to one or more Google Chat Rooms.  Each row contains **seven data fields** representing each lesson to be posted.  These fields are outlined below.

**1. Posted**

A checkbox ***automatically*** checked by **TSChatWise** when a lesson is posted to any Google Chat Room.

ðŸ‘‰ Add a checkbox for each new lesson


ðŸ‘‰ Use the spreadsheet **Insert > Checkbox** menu to add a new checkbox.

ðŸ‘‰ Make sure the checkbox is __unchecked__ before posting the lesson. 

ðŸ‘‰ Uncheck box to schedule/reschedule a lesson post. 

ðŸ‘‰ Ensure that there are no extraneous checkboxes in this column or **TSChatWise** will try to post empty lessons.

<br>


**2. Posted On**

Date stamp ***automatically*** added when a lesson is posted to any Google Chat Room.

ðŸ‘‰ Do not modify this field.

<br>


**3. Post as Card Message**

Indicates whether the lesson is to be posted as a **[Simple Messages](Tips.md#simple-messages)** or **[Card Messages](Tips.md#simple-messages)**.  


ðŸ‘‰ Add a checkbox for each new lesson.

ðŸ‘‰ Check the box to send as a **card message**.

ðŸ‘‰ Use the spreadsheet **Insert > Checkbox** menu to add a new checkbox.

ðŸ‘‰ Make sure there is an checkox in this column before posting the lesson.  

<br>


**4. Lesson Name**

Name of lesson to be posted with lesson.  

ðŸ‘‰ This is a **required field**.

<br>


**5. Lesson Description**

ðŸ‘‰  This is a **required field**.

ðŸ‘‰  Can contain additional formatting based upon type of message:  **[Simple Messages](Tips.md#simple-messages)** or **[Card Messages](Tips.md#simple-messages)**.  See [advanced formatting section](#Tips.md#simple-messages) below for more.

<br>


**6. Lesson Link**

Link to additional lesson content to be included with the posted lesson.  

ðŸ‘‰ This is a **optional field**.

ðŸ‘‰ Link will be added to the end of the message body for **[Simple Messages](https://developers.google.com/hangouts/chat/reference/message-formats/basic)** messages or as a clickable button link at the end of **[Card Messages](https://developers.google.com/hangouts/chat/reference/message-formats/cards)** messages.

<br>

**7. Lesson Image**
